It presents hardware design principles to all aspects of modern computer design: processor, input/output, memory, peripherals, and communication links.
The focus is on the design of a complete computer system. An understanding of hardware/software interaction and tradeoffs is necessary of computer specialists.
Even though the emphasis is on hardware, we have addressed a number of software issues, including basic aspects of operations systems related to instruction execution performance.
It is intended primarily for students who have already had a course in the design of logic circuits and had a basic knowledge of computer programming in a high-level language.
